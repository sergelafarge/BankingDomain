    "# Bank Domain\n",
    "- Classes: The code defines the classes Bank, Customer, Account, and SavingsAccount with their respective attributes and methods as described in the project description.   \n",
    "- Inheritance: The Account class inherits from the Bank class, and the SavingsAccount class inherits from the Account class, using super() to initialize the base class constructors.   \n",
    "- Constructors: All classes use parameterized constructors (__init__) to initialize object attributes.   \n",
    "- Methods: The classes implement the required methods: getAccountInfo(), deposit(), withdraw(), getBalance(), and getSavingAccountInfo(). The SavingsAccount class overrides the withdraw() method to include minimum balance validation.   \n",
    "- User Interaction: The BankProgram class handles user input to create Customer and Account objects and to perform deposit and withdrawal transactions.   \n",
    "- Transaction Handling: The perform_transaction() method in the BankProgram class allows users to deposit or withdraw amounts from their accounts.   \n",
    "- Minimum Balance Validation: The SavingsAccount class's withdraw() method checks if the withdrawal amount will reduce the balance below the minimum balance (SMinBalance).   \n",
    "- Program Flow: The BankProgram class's run() method provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the program.\n"
